The previous AI engineer successfully established the initial Codigo R application as a crypto trading ebook sales site. The primary challenge transitioned from feature development (landing page, admin panel, multi-language, legal disclaimers) to guiding the user through global deployment on Vercel and Railway. Due to user difficulties with file downloads, the engineer pivoted to providing manual, step-by-step instructions for creating and populating essential files directly on GitHub. The process was heavily focused on correcting file naming, content (especially JSON syntax in ), and directory structures, often requiring reiteration and simplification due to the user's technical unfamiliarity. Vercel deployments repeatedly failed, prompting a shift to Netlify, which also faced build issues. The current state reflects persistent deployment failures, largely stemming from incorrect file placement and missing directories within the GitHub repository, despite the engineer's clear guidance.

<product_requirements>
The user's core objective is to launch Codigo R, a global sales platform for a crypto trading ebook. The application requires a modern, futuristic landing page, including a Video Sales Letter (VSL) section. Key features include configurable purchase buttons for Hotmart and Monetizze, an optimized sales funnel, and a comprehensive, didactic administrative panel for full content editing (texts, VSL, sales funnel) and section visibility toggling. The design must be responsive with a dark/futuristic theme, supporting multiple languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, French). A prominent legal disclaimer, stating the ebook is not investment advice, is mandatory. The ultimate goal is global deployment, with Vercel and Railway recommended as hosting solutions. The current phase focuses on achieving this deployment.

The application's core functionality is developed, featuring a sales landing page, VSL, configurable purchase buttons, multi-language support, and a comprehensive admin panel. The immediate focus is resolving persistent deployment issues.

The previous AI engineer spent significant time guiding the user to manually transfer files to GitHub, as the user faced difficulties downloading a provided archive. This involved instructing the user to create files like , , , , , , , and minimal React boilerplate (, , ) by copying content from the AI's messages.

Initial Vercel deployments repeatedly failed due to syntax errors in  (user copying comments) and missing build scripts. The AI engineer corrected the  content and guided the user to configure Vercel settings (Root Directory, Build Command, Output Directory, Environment Variables) and then switched to Netlify for a simpler deployment process.

On Netlify, after initial setup and deployment attempts, the site displayed a Page not found (404) error. The AI engineer identified that the Netlify build settings were Not set despite prior attempts to configure them. After guiding the user to explicitly set these (Base directory: , Build command: , Publish directory: ), a subsequent redeploy still failed. The current problem, as identified by the AI engineer in the most recent messages, is that the  directory is missing from the GitHub repository, which is critical for the React application to build. The AI is now instructing the user to verify the  file and then create the  folder with its necessary files.
